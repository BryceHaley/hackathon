    "###CONCLUSION\n",
    "There are 7 billion people divided into communities. Each community has about 10,000 people in it. That means there are only seven hundred thousand communities. Each community has 50 rationing stations. Every time a new ship carrying humans comes in, it also carries some food for the rationing stations. Once a month, people have to go to the rationing stations and get their food. Rationing solves the problem of not having food on Mars because people will be given food in an organized fashion with equity. Rationing on Mars is a good system if organized properly, which will be done with the communities and designated rationing stations. We understand, however, that Earth will not provide us with food forever. That is why we have created a farming system, which you will find out more about in the next paragraph.\n",
    "Once everybody is on Mars, we will start having to grow our own food. Although this wasn't part of our project, we wanted to include this either way. We will do this by turning carbon dioxide and nitrogen into oxygen by zapping them with a nuclear pumped laser. It will cause a nuclear fusion between the particles turning them into oxygen. The test for turning nitrogen into oxygen was first conducted by Ernest Rutherford.  We can use this oxygen to help grow the plants. We can also collect water from the steam from volcanoes. Given these points we should be able to organize the limited amount of food on Mars to serve the community as a whole through rationing.\n",
