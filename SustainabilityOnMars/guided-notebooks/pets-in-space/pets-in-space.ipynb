    "As one of the world's leading experts on cute animals, NASA has asked you to help decide which pets to bring onto Mars, since it might get lonely out there. In this adventure, you will learn datascience skills  and solve several challenges that will help you reach your goal. \n",

You can also check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-j7ku2URmjZ1F3-9jvBuvsf0KcWPsxab) video series that can help you cover some basics. Remember, to \"run\" a notebook cell, we can either use the button above or press `shift + enter`. Make sure you do this in every cell that starts with `Run this cell` and cells you write code in. If it doesn't work, try hitting the stop button (square button on the top bar) and try again.\n",

The data file they gave us is called `pets_from_bootstrap_world.csv` - the .csv at the end tells us it is a csv file. The CSV stands for \"Comma Separated Values\", there is a special function in the `pandas` library we can use to view this data file called `read_csv()`. \n",

For example, if I wanted to use the `loadtxt()` function from the `numpy` library, I would have to write it like `numpy.loadtxt('file.txt')`. See how the library is first, then there is a `.`, followed by the function? We then use the function on the file by putting the filename in the brackets. The file name is surrounded by `\"` `\"` so that it is read as characters. "
