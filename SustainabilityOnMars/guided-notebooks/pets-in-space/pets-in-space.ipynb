You can also check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-j7ku2URmjZ1F3-9jvBuvsf0KcWPsxab) video series that can help you cover some basics. Remember, to \"run\" a notebook cell, we can either use the button above or press `shift + enter`. Make sure you do this in every cell that starts with `Run this cell` and cells you write code in. If it doesn't work, try hitting the stop button and try again.\n",

See how the library is first, then there is a `.`, followed by the function? We then use the function on the file by putting the filename in the brackets.
