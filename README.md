# Hackathon Challenges and Resources

These are notebooks and other resources to use as challenges for Callysto hackathons or related events. You're also welcome to use them for other non-commercial purposes.

Notebooks in this branch were tested on [Callysto Hub](https://hub.callysto.ca).

### Callysto Hub basics
  
Callysto Hub is a free Jupyter notebook environment provided by [Cybera](https://www.cybera.ca/) and [PIMS](https://www.pims.math.ca/), and it's available [here](https://hub.callysto.ca). 

In order to log in to Callysto  - you can  use your Google account, or a Microsoft account.  
     
Once you have logged in first time - your personal environment will be created, where all your work will be stored.


### Copy notebooks to Callysto Hub
   
 Hackathon notebooks can be automatically copied to the Callysto Hub using this [bitly link](http://bit.ly/callysto-prep-materials).
   
 Alternatively, to copy them  manually:
 
- select `New` -> `Terminal` in the top right corner  
- in the terminal window type `git clone https://github.com/callysto/hackathon -b jupyter`
